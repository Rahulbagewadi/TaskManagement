To run this project we need code editor, I have used VS Code , install node.js, vite we can refer documentation provided by https://vitejs.dev/guide/
After following the steps and giving proper command we get all dependencies get installed 
The main files required are index.html
And in src folder we have main.jsx, App.jsx, Header.jsx,ToDo.jsx and App.css
